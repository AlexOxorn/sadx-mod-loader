Sonic Adventure DX PC Mod Loader
================================
Changelog


What's new in Version 3.1?
--------------------------

* Rewrote the build system using CMake instead of relying on
  Visual Studio projects.

* Refactored much of the source code into separate classes in order to
  reduce the size of dllmain.cpp.

* Initial support for Unicode filenames.

* Split headers into multiple files to make things easier to manage.
  SADXModLoader.h includes all of the individual files, so it's
  effectively the same as before.

* Lots of optimizations and fixes.

* Initial documentation for the binary code file format.
